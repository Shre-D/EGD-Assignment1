### Instructions to run the project

First, make sure you have  `git` installed. Then use the url under the clone section to clone this repository on your system.
If you want to experiment around with it, consider forking the repository instead.

#### Cloning
For cloning after copying the url, use `git clone <url>`

#### Activating a virtual environment
Run `python -m venv env` and `source env/bin/activate`

#### Installing dependencies
First use `pip install -r requirements.txt` to install the dependencies.

Once that's done, navigate into the `main.ipynb` file to make changes or just run the code.
